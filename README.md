# Ideas for how to make scientific Python faster

Inspired by the [Faster CPython Ideas](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas) repository and proposed [here](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/towards-a-faster-python-project-for-scientific-python/1294
), this repository is a cross-project location:

- to collect user stories, pain points and (however rough) ideas
- to collect individual incremental wins within various projects/libraries across the ecosystem

New ideas should be created as new [issues](https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/issues/new/choose).  It is ok if the idea is not fully formed---we treat them as discussions to arrive at something actionable.
